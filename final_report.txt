📊 MODEL EVALUATION SUMMARY

✅ Overall Accuracy: 78%
- This means the model correctly classifies 78 out of every 100 frames.

📍 Class-wise Metrics:
- 'Accident':
  - Precision: 0.78 (correctly labeled accidents among all predicted accidents)
  - Recall: 0.20 (missed many true accident cases)
  - F1-score: 0.32

- 'Non-Accident':
  - Precision: 0.78
  - Recall: 0.98 (almost all non-accidents correctly identified)
  - F1-score: 0.87

🧠 Confusion Matrix Insights:
- False Negatives (missed accidents) are high — 2292 out of 2883
- True Negatives (non-accidents correctly identified): 8205

📈 Learning Curves:
- Training accuracy improved steadily.
- Validation accuracy plateaued and dipped slightly — suggests overfitting.
